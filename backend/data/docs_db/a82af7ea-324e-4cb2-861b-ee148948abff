## Table 1. Glioma Grading Scale.

| Grade   | Characteristics                                                                                                                               |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| I       | Slow growing cells Almost normal appearance Least malignant Usually associated with long-term survival                                        |
| II      | Relatively slow growing cells Slightly abnormal appearance Can invade nearby tissue Sometimes recur as a higher grade                         |
| III     | Actively reproducing abnormal cells Abnormal appearance Infiltrate normal tissue Tend to recur, often as a higher grade                       |
| IV      | Rapidly reproducing abnormal cells Very abnormal appearance Area of dead cells (necrosis) in center Form new blood vessels to maintain growth |


## What causes brain tumors?

Medical science neither knows what causes brain tumors nor how to prevent primary tumors that start in the brain. People most at risk for brain tumors include those who have:

- · cancer elsewhere in the body
- · prolonged exposure to pesticides, industrial solvents, and other chemicals
- · inherited diseases, such as neurofibromatosis

Figure 2. Brain tumor symptoms are related to the functional areas of the brain, giving doctors clues as to the tumor location.

It includes the frontal lobe (blue), parietal lobe (orange), temporal lobe (green), occipital lobe (purple), cerebellum (yellow), and brainstem (pink). Additionally, the motor strip and sensory strip are labeled within the parietal lobe.
