## Recovery &amp; prevention


## Self care

Your primary care doctor and oncologist should discuss any home care needs with you and your family. Supportive measures vary according to your symptoms. For example, canes or walkers can help those having trouble walking. A plan of care to address changes in mental status should be adapted to each patient's needs.

## Recurrence

How well a tumor will respond to treatment, remain in remission, or recur after treatment depends on the specific tumor type and location. A recurrent tumor may be a tumor that still persists after treatment, one that grows back some time after treatment destroyed it, or a new tumor that grows in the same place as the original one.

When a brain tumor is in remission, the tumor cells have stopped growing or multiplying. Periods of remission vary. In general, benign tumors recur less often than malignant ones.

Since it is impossible to predict whether or when a particular tumor may recur, lifelong monitoring with MRI or CT scans is essential for people treated for a brain tumor, even a benign lesion. Follow-up scans may be performed every 3 to 6 months or annually, depending on the type of tumor you had.

## Glossary

anaplastic: when cells divide rapidly and bear little or no resemblance to normal cells in appearance or function.

astrocytoma: a tumor arising in the supportive cells (astrocytes) of the brain or spinal cord; most often in the cerebrum.

benign : does not invade nearby tissues or spread; noncancerous.

biopsy : a sample of tissue cells for examination under a microscope to determine the existence or cause of a disease.

brachytherapy : a type of radiation therapy where capsules containing radioactive substances are surgically implanted into the tumor to deliver radiation; also called internal radiotherapy. cancer : generic term for more than 100 different diseases caused by uncontrolled, abnormal growth of cells. Cancer cells can invade and destroy normal tissue, and can travel through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to reach other parts of the body. chemotherapy : treatment with toxic chemicals (e.g., anticancer drugs).

chondrosarcoma: a rare, malignant bone tumor arising from primitive notochord cells and composed of cartilage.

chordoma : a rare, bone tumor arising from of the spine (sacrum) or at the skull base (clivus).

craniopharyngioma cells located near the pituitary stalk.

primitive notochord cells; usually occurs at the base : a benign tumor arising from differentiation : refers to how developed cancer cells are in a tumor. Well-differentiated tumor cells resemble normal cells and tend to grow and spread at a slower rate than undifferentiated, which lack the structure and function of normal cells and grow uncontrollably.

edema : tissue swelling caused by the accumulation of fluid.

ependymoma : a tumor arising from the ependyma cells lining the ventricles of the brain and central canal of the spinal cord.

epidermoid : a benign, congenital tumor arising from ectodermal cells; also called pearly tumor. glioma : any tumor arising from glial tissue of the brain, which provides energy, nutrients, and other support for nerve cells in the brain.

hydrocephalus : an abnormal build-up of cerebrospinal fluid usually caused by a blockage of
